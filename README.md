My curriculum vitae is distributed in 4 seccions: The profile where I describe all the information related to myself and a photo.
My programing levels where there are all the lenguages that I've practiced or am practicing and the valoration I give my skills in each one.
The lenguages that I speak and their levels.

VISUAL DESIGN:

The font family I will use wich I think that suits the subject perfectly is font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif

I will align all the items so it seems like they are on a paper.

For the font color i've thought on using my favourite color which is: dark blue
